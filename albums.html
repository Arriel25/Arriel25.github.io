            <p>Love 119 is RIIZE's single released in early 2024. It is a pop dance song that contrasts a sweet piano accompaniment with a rhythmic drum line to create a dreamy atmosphere. The lyrics of the song compare a sudden first love to an emergency situation, and the members express the emotion of first love in the style of RIIZE and the group's unique musical style, “Emotional Pop”. The dance for the chorus of the song was choreographed by members Shotaro and Won Bin.</p><br>

            <p><i>RIIZING</i> is RIIZE's debut mini-album released on June 17, 2024, featuring the songs “Impossible” and “Boom Boom Bass”. <b>Impossible</b> is a pop dance song characterized by dynamic ho-room rhythms and mysterious synthesiser atmosphere. The lyrics express that even if everyone thinks it is ‘impossible’, as long as they walk towards the same dream with each other, ‘impossible’ will become ‘impossible’ in that instant. The lyrics convey the message that even if everyone thinks it's “impossible”, as long as they are walking together towards the same dream, the “impossible” will become “possible” in that moment. Also, the choreography for the hip-hop style song <b>Siren</b> is very watchable and difficult. The stage for this song is very watchable.</p>
